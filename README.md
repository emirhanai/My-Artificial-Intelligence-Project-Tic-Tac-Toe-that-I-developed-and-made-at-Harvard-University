# **My Artificial Intelligence Project (Tic Tac Toe) that I developed and made at Harvard University...**
I completed the homework given by Brian Yu and Mr. Malan (David J. Malan) at Harvard University, which I studied. All of the codes are original, but since the logic of this software is the same, I think everyone will do it this way. The only difference may be increasing the number of functions or using loops. In addition, I lost against the computer in a small attempt :( Good luck...

**I am happy to present this software to you!**
